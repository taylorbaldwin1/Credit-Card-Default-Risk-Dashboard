# Credit-Card-Default-Risk-Dashboard
💳 Credit Card Default Risk Prediction & Dashboard
Project Overview

This repository contains a Machine Learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of credit card default. The primary objective is to demonstrate that ML and visual analytics methods can achieve strong predictive performance while still providing meaningful, interpretable insights that can aid financial institutions in managing portfolio risk and advancing explainable AI practices.

The project includes:
* Data preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Model training and evaluation
* A simple web-based dashboard for visualizing key insights and model performance

🔑 Key Features

* Risk Prediction Model: Decision Tree Classifier for default prediction.
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Missing value handling, categorical encoding, scaling, and feature selection.
* Model Evaluation: Includes Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
* Dashboard Visualization: An index.html file showcasing data distributions and model insights (via D3.js, Plotly, or other tools).
* Sample Data: Cleaned and sampled dataset files for demonstration.
